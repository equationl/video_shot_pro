ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* R.txt
* aapt\
* aapt\AndroidManifest.xml
* classes.jar
* jni\
* jni\armeabi-v7a\
* jni\armeabi-v7a\libARM_ARCH.so
* jni\armeabi\
* jni\armeabi\libARM_ARCH.so
* jni\x86\
* jni\x86\libARM_ARCH.so

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => fFmpegAndroid\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => fFmpegAndroid\src\main\assets\
* res\ => fFmpegAndroid\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
